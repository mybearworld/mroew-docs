title: To do
description: Things still left to do for Mröw and its docs.
---

Mröw is currently not entirely feature complete, and the docs don't describe everything there is to describe.

Ideally, this page will be deletable in the future :)

## Mröw

- **Custom block support**. You can just make a function for now, but you can't pass in runtime arguments or run without screen refresh.

## Docs

- **Blocks overview**. You can use the autocomplete for that right now, but it's not the most ideal thing.
- **Information on extending Mröw**. This is an important part of Mröw, and it's currently entirely undocumented.
